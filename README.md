# Weather-Dashboard-


#Description
The weather dashboard allows the user to take current and future forecast, so they are able to look at the weather for the next 5 days. It will include the city, humidity, wind and temperature. Does require some further tweaking as the API information displays in console but makes cards disappear. I will be tweaking this moving forward and resubmitting. While also adding local storage in future updates. 


##API USED
https://openweathermap.org/current (Current Day)
https://openweathermap.org/forecast5 (5Day forcast)
